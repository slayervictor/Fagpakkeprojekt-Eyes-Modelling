Lix is a readability index that measures the complexity of a text based on the average sentence length and the percentage of words that are long words. The formula for Lix is:\
\
\\[ \\text\{Lix\} = \\frac\{\\text\{Words\}\}\{\\text\{Sentences\}\} + \\frac\{(\\text\{Long words\} \\times 100)\}\{\\text\{Words\}\} \\]\
\
Here, "long words" are words with six or more letters.\
\
To determine the Lix score for S\'f8ren Kierkegaard's writing style, we would need to analyze a specific text or passage. Kierkegaard's writing is often characterized by its depth and philosophical complexity, which might result in a higher Lix score. However, without a specific text to analyze, it's challenging to provide an accurate Lix score for his overall body of work.\
