en, where the North Sea and the Baltic Sea meet, lived a lighthouse keeper named Niels.
Niels was a man of solitude, his life as steady and predictable as the beam of light from his lighthouse.

Each night, as he lit the lamp, he felt a sense of purpose, a connection to the sea and the sailors who relied on his light.
One day, a storm hit Skagen.
