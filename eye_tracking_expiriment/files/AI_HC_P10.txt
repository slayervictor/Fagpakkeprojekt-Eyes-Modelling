In a kingdom far away, there was a wise and just king named Frederick. He ruled his kingdom with kindness and fairness, earning the love and respect of his subjects.
One day, a bird with feathers as bright as the sun and a song as sweet as the morning dew arrived in the kingdom. The bird sang so beautifully that everyone in the kingdom stopped to listen. The king, upon hearing the bird's song, was so moved that he declared the bird to be a treasure of the kingdom.
The king built a golden cage for the bird in his palace. Every day, the bird would sing its beautiful song, bringing joy to the king and his subjects. However, as days turned into weeks, the bird's song grew less frequent and less vibrant.
The king, noticing the change, asked the bird why it was not singing as it used to. The bird replied, "I long for the freedom of the skies, the warmth of the sun, and the scent of the flowers. I am a bird of the wild, and while your cage is golden, it is still a cage."
Hearing this, the king realized his mistake. He opened the cage and set the bird free. As the bird soared into the sky, it sang a song so beautiful and joyful that it brought tears to the king's eyes. From that day forward, the king understood that true beauty and joy could not be caged.
And so, King Frederick ruled his kingdom with even greater wisdom, always remembering the lesson taught by the bird with the golden feathers.
