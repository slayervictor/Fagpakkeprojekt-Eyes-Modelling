“An old maid is leaning out of a window, plucking the withered leaves from her
____________, and looking over the green rampart where happy children are
playing.”

“And they are dancing and playing on the green rampart, on that very spot where,
as the old story goes, the ground always sank in until an innocent child was
lured with flowers and toys into its ____________ grave, which was walled up
even while the child played.”

“Then the years roll on; ____________ days come, but youth is ever hopeful.”

“Each year that tree puts forth fresh green shoots; but the ____________ does
not, and the clouds that pass over the mind of man are heavier and darker than
ever the northern skies have known.”

“Your bridegroom’s bridal chamber shall be a ____________, and you shall live
on, an old maid; from Vartou you shall peer through the balsam blossoms, watch
the children at play, and see your own history repeated.”
